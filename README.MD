SimplePortals (SP) is a minecraft mod that adds constructable portals that allow intra- and interdimensional travel.

Design
======
This is supposed to serve as a rough overview of the mods inner workings.

All portal related data is stored in a central registry. This registry is saved and loaded utilizing world save data. This way there is no need for the usual setup of other mods that use some sort of tile entity backed controller block.
